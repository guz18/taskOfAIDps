## About The Project
I used LSTM algorithm because we had previous data and we are asked to make predictions on next year.
I trained the four models each time I either implemented a different algorithm 
or different approach to model training. 
All of these models and their steps to training are explained in the files named:
* trainingModel[number].ipynb number is [1,2,3,4]

1- The first task was ' visualise historically the number of accidents per category (column1). '
Here is my graph taken from the [drawingGraph.ipynb] file
